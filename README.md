Automatic Modulation Classification using Deep Learning Models
Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a pivotal role in modern wireless communication systems, facilitating efficient spectrum management, adaptive communication strate- gies, and bolstered security measures. With the rapid advancements in deep learning, es- pecially with the introduction of transformer-based architectures, AMC has seen significant improvements in handling complex signal environments while also reducing computational overhead. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of various deep learning models applied to AMC, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neu- ral Networks (RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a custom Transformer-based model. The custom Transformer model is enhanced with CNN layers to improve feature extraction capabilities. These models are evaluated on the Deepsig RadioML 2018.01A dataset, a benchmark in the field, to analyze their architectural innovations, computational efficiency, and classification accuracy. The results highlight the strengths and trade-offs of each model, providing valuable insights into the design of more robust and efficient AMC systems for future wireless communications.
